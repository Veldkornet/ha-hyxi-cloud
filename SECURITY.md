## Reporting a Vulnerability

Security is taken very seriously. Since this integration handles cloud API keys, please **do not** report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it privately:

1. Go to the **Security** tab of this repository.
2. Click on **Advisories** (or "Report a vulnerability").
3. Submit the details privately.

Please provide as much detail as possible, including steps to reproduce the issue. I will do my best to respond within a timely manner, verify the vulnerability, and release a patched version as quickly as possible.
